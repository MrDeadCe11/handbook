## How To: The Bridge to xDAI and wxDAI from Eth Mainnet

This tutorial assumes that you already have DAI in your wallet, if you do not you will need to swap for it on your preferred exchange.

### Step 1:
Go to your Metamask wallet, click on the networks tab and go to “Custom RPC”.

**Input the following in each of the blanks:**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vBnGM5N.png" alt="Metamask RPC Setup"/>

### Step 2:
Visit https://dai-bridge.poa.network/

Once you are on the xDAI bridge site, you will see the amount of Dai you have on Ethereum Mainnet as well as the amount of xDAI that you have available on xDAI Chain. (You can easily navigate between xDai side chain and Ethereum Mainnet if you click on the networks tab your Metamask Wallet)

### Step 3:
In order to swap your Mainnet Dai for xDAI, you need to be connected to Ethereum Mainnet. If you want to swap your xDAI for DAI, you need to be connectec to xDAI Side chain.

**To swap your tokens enter the amount you are looking to swap and hit “transfer”.**
… And just like that, you have your xDAI on xDAI Side Chain


##How To: Bridge to Gnosis Chain from Polygon

### Step 1: Matic > dai > xdai

The rest of us need to start on a layer 2 solution like Polygon. Right now there are at least 3 centralized exchanges that allow direct withdrawal of funds to the Polygon/Matic layer 2 chain: [Binance,](https://www.binance.com/en) [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), and [kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/).  

In order to get funds on to the xDai chain without passing through the Ethereum Mainnet (and thus incurring huge gas fees) you have to start from one of these centralized exchanges.  

So ... buy you some Polygon/Matic from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) or [kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) and then withdraw the funds to your MetaMask wallet address on the Polygon chain.

- [Getting MATIC on the Polygon network with Kucoin](https://medium.com/@nifty.pixels/getting-matic-on-the-polygon-network-with-kucoin-bc2de9f7b2d9)

If you haven't already you're going to need to set up your MetaMask wallet with the Polygon chain. See here for instructions on how to [Configure Polygon on Metamask.](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/)

Now that you have some Matic on the Polygon Mainnet in your MetaMask wallet you can go on to the next step ... swapping your Matic to something else!

For this step you'll need a DEX, or decentralized exchange.  If you have a favorite that operates on Polygon use that.  If not you can use either [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/) or [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/).

Connect your wallet to the DEX and make sure you're on the right chain in your MetaMask wallet. (Hint: it's Polygon [Matic].)

Select your starting token (Matic) and the token you wish to swap to. In this case you will swap to Dai.

Enter the amount you want to swap, and click the swap button.  Confirm the transaction in MetaMask, sign it, and wait for it to be mined.

 **DO NOT SWAP 100% OF YOUR MATIC TO DAI**. 

Make sure you leave some Matic in your wallet to pay for any swapping fees (gas). One remaining Matic should be enough.

Now that you have your Dai on the Polygon network it's time to move on to step... 11-ish? Take me to the bridge!

### Step 2: Bridging Funds from Polygon to xdai

In web3 a [bridge](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8) is a system that allows for the transfer of information between two or more blockchains.  For this particular bridge we're going to use [xPollinate](https://xpollinate.io/).

Go to [xpollinate.io](https://xpollinate.io/) and connect your wallet.

Then select Polygon as the "from" chain and xDai as the "to" chain, and Dai as the token to be transferred.

![Screenshot from 2021-12-08 21-47-25.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dd5ad261-8292-4002-bbb0-3d104fcc08d5/Screenshot_from_2021-12-08_21-47-25.png)

Enter the amount you want to bridge and click the button that says swap.  Wait for the transaction to be mined, confirm and collect the swap and *voila*!  You now have xDai on the xDai chain!  You're almost halfway there!

- If you don't have the xDai chain in your MetaMask now would be a good time to add it See [Setting up MetaMask for xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup)

### How to Wrap my xDAI to get wxDAI?
Visit https://wrapeth.com/

If you are connected to Ethereum Mainnet, click on your MetaMask browser exstension, toggle networks, and switch to your xDAI network.

You will see that the interface changes to reflect your change to xDAI Side chain.

**Select the amount you want to wrap and click submit!**

### OR Sushiswap

We're going to go back to [sushiswap](https://sushi.com/).  Connect your wallet and select the xDai chain.

Select xDai as the "Swap From" and wxDai as the "Swap To"

Enter the amount of xDai you'd like to wrap (**once again, do not wrap 100% of your xDai—you'll need some to pay for swap fees**) and click the "wrap" button. Confirm and sign the transaction and wait for it to be mined, and ...
